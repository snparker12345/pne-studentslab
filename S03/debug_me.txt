a division by zero error happened. this will always happen when c and d passed into function f
are the same. this is because c and d are passed into function g, which subtracts them and
returns the result. this result is assigned to the variable t1. then, t0/t1 is performed. if t1
is 0 because the two values are equivalent, there will be a zero division error.
